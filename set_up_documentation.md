Setting up a Succinct Data Build Environment for Developers=============================Batphone and succinct setup:
=============================Requirements:
-GitHub Account – www.github.com
- https://github.com/servalproject/batphone/blob/development/INSTALL.md ^^^ states 80 MB free space, this is only relevant to batphone, with the android SDK and NDK etc… its more around 10 GB.
-Mac OSX 10.9 working, others not tested. (10.7 supported according to INSTALL.MD)Supposedly works on Linux, I did not test this.
-Android phone, for testing properly. (IPhone available soon, supposedly)
Recommendations:
Listen to guide, use home directory; I did not, headaches occurred.
Steps:
Clone the batphone(https://github.com/servalproject/batphone/) directory down. Can fork to upload changes to your own GitHub account to avoid having to have master accepting all the time. So:````git clone https://github.com/servalproject/batphone.git````^^ For clone from master, if forked URL will be the path of batphone in your account.
